# TuxDrive
A Linux Google Drive desktop client

<h3>Development progresses</h3>
TuxDrive is mantained over two different branches, Master and Devel. <br>
**Master** is the current stable release (altough atm there are no actual releases since the software is not ready yet) and will be update only when a new version is released. <br>
**Devel** is the active development branch. It is mostly not working code that needs to be finished, polished or debugged. There can be 
half written functions, bad implementations, errors and random shenaningans. Check the latest commit to see if the updates are marked as NOT WORKING.
